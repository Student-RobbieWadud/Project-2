This is my README file.

My Git repository is https://github.com/Student-RobbieWadud/Project-2.git

There are four files in this project: infile, makefile, palindrome, master

infile: a text file that has example strings of palindromes and non-palindromes (both numbers and strings)

makefile: the makefile needed to run this program

palindrome: the first cpp file

master: the second and main cpp file

Steps to use this program:
	type in "make"
	type in "./master -n x -s x infile.txt"
	type in "make clean" (after the program runs)
